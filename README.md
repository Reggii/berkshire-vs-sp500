## Beyond the bloodbath
Continuing on our merry road after the 2008 crisis, Berkshire Hathaway's stock price was continuing to show signs of strength against the S&P 500, however at times did not deviate from it too far as either.

## The big picure and conclusions
Of course drawing comparisons between an index and a hedge fund is not too practical, Berkshire Hathaway has a very wide spanning portfolio of solid companies in a variety of industries which can make its price a lot more resiliant than the S&P, just off of diversity alone. \
Additionally we do not take into account any divident payouts when looking at these charts.

However, there's still something to be said about Buffett's genius at playing a crisis to his advantage. The money for Berkshire Hathaway is made when everyone is at their peak of uncertainty and fear, while all are selling, someone's buying. And one of those someones has clearly been Buffett. You can see that the swings upwards after a crisis are always larger for Berkshire than for the S&P
